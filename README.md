## Use case

## Approach

We felt that the use case closely resembles the Amazon online and brick&mortar store approach [Amazon Go]
(https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16008589011).
Offering people personalized suggestions and discounts on any screen they prefer to use (be it a hand-held 
scanner or their mobile devices).

This drove us to develop a Python Web App that we are running from a Raspberry Pi and are accessing from a phone 
and a tablet.

Just to make things interesting, it seemed fun to incorporate a fully functional barcode scanner in the webapp (since we 
had a camera at our disposal).

## Setup 



### Web server and web app

### Telegram
<b>Setting up Telegram to receive notifications</b><br/>
In order to use Telegram as a notification server, you need to create a bot.
Creating bots is wel documented in multiple blogs and tutorials so we won't go in to much detail
here.

After installing and login into telegram, search for the BotFather bot (note the blue checkmark)<br/>

Send it the message 
`/start`

And follow the new bot wizard by sending
`/newbot`

When your bot is created you should receive a message like the one below containing your access token.
With this token you can control your bot so don't just hand it out. <br/>

From this point on you can interact with your bot. Search for your bot and send the start message and some random text 
(you need to do this in order to complete the following steps). <br/>

Next open a browser and send a getUpdates call to your bot on the url
`https://api.telegram.org/bot<api_key>/getUpdates`

This will give you the following information<br/>

The obfuscted value is the id of the chat between the bot and myself (if someone else starts chatting 
with this bot they will receive a different chat id). This value and the api key will be required in confluenct.

Sending a message to the bot can be done in the same way:
`https://api.telegram.org/bot<api_key>/sendMessage?chatid=<chatid>&text="hello world"`

### Confluent
We used Confluent Cloud to capture and correlate data generated by the user. More specifically location information gathered
by tracking the customer in the store and product information when a customer scans a specific product.

We build 4 processing streams in confluent: 
 - Generating promotion information based on the customers lcoation
 - Generating a digital shopping cart based on scanned items
 - Generating food pairing suggestions based on scanned items
 - Generating a digital receipt when the shopping is concluded
<br />

The 2 main triggers are being captured in real-time and provide the start of the streams.
 - User tracking
 - Scanned products




#### Telegram sink connector
In order to get telegram working from the confluent cloud need to create a http sink connector.
We used 3 different notification, each with their own input topic
 - Pairing: get a food pairing based on an item you scan
 - Promotion: get a (list of) promotion(s) 
 - Receipt: get your digital receipt

You can find each configuration in the telegram_sink folder. The telegram connection is constructed from the following
parameters
 - "http.api.url": "https://api.telegram.org/bot<api key>/sendMessage",
 - "batch.prefix": "{\"chat_id\":\"<chat id>\",",
 - "batch.suffix": "}",
 - "regex.patterns": ".*PA_PAIRINGNAME=(.*?),.*ITEMNAME=(.*?)}",
 - "regex.replacements": "\"text\":\"$1 pairs very well with $2\"",
 - "regex.separator": "~",

They construct the sendMessage api call to your bot.
